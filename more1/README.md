I thought when I started this project that it was going to be easier than it was.  I couldn't get the reverse video to work to output bytes when input is read from stdin.  I really wished that we went over the reverse video in class more because it took a lot of work to figure that out.  I didn't have as much fun with this one as with some of the other projects for sure.
