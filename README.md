This program definetly provided me with a learning experience. I had more trouble than I though I would implementing 
-n. And because I am using a unix terminal for window's still I haven't been able to experience linux the way I want to.
I wasn't able to push to github because I don't think I have been added to the class directory yet.  I ran out of time and was unable to 
write a .gitignore file also.
