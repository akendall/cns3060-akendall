The algorithms weren't too dificult to understand, but I had a terrible time coding them.  It took me a lot longer than I expected it to. But to my great suprize the round robin part took the longest.  Conceptually I get it but getting it to work how I wanted it too was the difficult part, I never got it exactly how I wanted it but I don't feel like I can take more time to code it. But now that it is over I am happy.
