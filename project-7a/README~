I Love that I didn't have to use c and could go back to using some java code.  The biggest difficulty that I had with this project was getting it to run on my computer.  But when it finally ran it was awesome.  The code for all the different simulators was fun to write.  It wasn't too challenging, but it was pretty rewarding. I couldn't think of any files that would be contained in a .gitignore file, unless I ignored my simulation.class file, so I made my gitignore file ignore that.
